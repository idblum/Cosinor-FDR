Cosinor-FDR
===========
These MATLAB algorithms are intended to fit a sinewave to a dataset with previously measured periodic rhythms and then compare this modeled data against another sampled parameter, i.e. comparing blood or dialysate concentrations (low sampling frequency) against locomotor activity (high sampling frequency).

The comparison is made using a non-parametric procedure to estimate the false discovery rate (expressed as a percentage) that these two parameters appear correlated (and rhythmic) when they are not.
